# Demo Asset Checklist

Add final demo artifacts in this folder before sharing the project publicly.

## Required files

1. `dashboard.png`
2. `create-payment.png`
3. `payment-lifecycle.gif`
4. `refund-flow.png`
5. `webhook-events.png`

## Capture guidance

1. Use one merchant account from a clean database state.
2. Show the end-to-end lifecycle:
   create payment -> authenticate -> capture -> refund.
3. Include one webhook sync screen/log proof.
4. Keep any secret values masked in screenshots.
5. Prefer 1366x768 or higher so text is readable on LinkedIn/GitHub.
